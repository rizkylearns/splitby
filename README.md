# About

This module splits string into a { split, splat } object based on the separator parameter. This is useful when a string has a separator pattern, for example this<end>is<end>a<end>pattern<end>sentence.
The output property *split* is an array of substrings that ends with the separator. The output property *splat* is an array of remainder substring.
